The problem described is to understand the consumer behavior and preferences in terms of the cost of ride-hailing services. The goal is to determine how much customers are willing to pay for these services and how it affects their choice of ride service provider. Despite the growing popularity of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, the contribution of these services to the total vehicle miles traveled is relatively low, indicating significant room for attracting new customers and increasing their usage.
